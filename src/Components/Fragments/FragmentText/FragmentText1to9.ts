Deathless Aphrodite of the spangled mind,
child of Zeus, who twists lures, I beg you
do not break with hard pains,
      O lady, my heart

but come here if ever before
you caught my voice far off
and listening left your father’s
      golden house and came,

yoking your car. And fine birds brought you,
quick sparrows over the black earth
whipping their wings down the sky
      through midair—

they arrived. But you, O blessed one,
smiled in your deathless face
and asked what (now again) I have suffered and why
      (now again) I am calling out

and what I want to happen most of all
in my crazy heart. Whom should I persuade (now again)
to lead you back into her love? Who, O
      Sappho, is wronging you?

For if she flees, soon she will pursue.
If she refuses gifts, rather will she give them.
If she does not love, soon she will love
      even unwilling.

Come to me now: loose me from hard
care and all my heart longs
to accomplish, accomplish. You
      be my ally.

here to me from Krete to this holy temple
where is your graceful grove
of apple trees and altars smoking
      with frankincense.

And in it cold water makes a clear sound through
apple branches and with roses the whole place
is shadowed and down from radiant-shaking leaves
      sleep comes dropping.

And in it a horse meadow has come into bloom
with spring flowers and breezes
like honey are blowing
      [              ]

In this place you Kypris taking up
in gold cups delicately
nectar mingled with festivities:
      pour.

O Kypris and Nereids, undamaged I pray you
grant my brother to arrive here.
And all that in his heart he wants to be,

And all the wrong he did before, loose it.
Make him a joy to his friends,
a pain to his enemies and let there exist for us
      not one single further sorrow.
